Configuring Git with your user information and password involves setting your name and email address for Git commits, and optionally configuring credential
caching for convenience. Here are the steps to configure Git with your user information and password:

1. Set Your Git Username and Email
These commands set your username and email for Git commits globally (across all repositories on your system).
If you want to set it for a specific repository, omit the --global flag and run these commands inside the repository.


git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
2. Configure Git to Cache Your Password
To avoid having to enter your username and password each time you push to a remote repository, you can configure Git to cache your credentials.

For HTTPS URLs
Option 1: Git Credential Helper (Simple Cache)
This caches your credentials in memory for a set period of time (default is 15 minutes).


git config --global credential.helper cache
To set a custom cache timeout (e.g., 1 hour):


git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
Option 2: Git Credential Store
This stores your credentials in a plain text file in your home directory, which is not recommended for sensitive data due to security risks.


git config --global credential.helper store
This creates a file ~/.git-credentials containing your username and password.

PREFERRED VARIANT

For SSH URLs
Using SSH keys is more secure and avoids the need to enter a password each time you push or pull.

Generate an SSH key pair (if you don't already have one):


ssh-keygen -t ed255196 -C "your.email@example.com"
the line above is the most secure fast tradeoff, far better than the chatgpt suggested option
which fallsback to rsa for legacz systems

Follow the prompts to save the key in the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) and optionally set a passphrase.

Add your SSH key to the SSH agent:


eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
line above in bash in fish:
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Add your SSH key to your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account:

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Add the copied key to your account on the platform.
Configure Git to use the SSH URL for your repository:
Change the remote URL to use SSH instead of HTTPS:




git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
Example: Full Setup for GitHub
Set up user details:

sh
Copy code
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@example.com"
Configure credential caching:

sh
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper cache
Generate and add SSH key:

sh
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "john.doe@example.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.

Change the remote URL to SSH:

sh
Copy code
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
By following these steps, you configure Git with your user information and set up convenient and secure ways to manage authentication when interacting with remote repositories.
